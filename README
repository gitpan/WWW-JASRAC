    WWW::JASRAC - Interact With JASRAC Search Interface

DESCRIPTION
    BEWARE! EXTREMELY ALPHA SOFTWARE!

    WWW::JASRAC is a module to query and extract data out of JASRAC
    (Japanese Society for Rights of Authors, Composers and Publishers)
    site's search capabilities.

METHOD
  new %ARGS
    Creates a new WWW::JASRAC instance. The following arguments are
    accepted:

    ie  The input (i.e. what YOU supply) encoding. Default is 'euc-jp'.

    oe  The output (i.e. what comes out of WWW::JASRAC) encoding. Default is
        'euc-jp'

  search %ARGS
    You can specify the following query criteria:

    code
        The JASRAC code

    title
        The title of the song.

    artist
        The name of the artist.

    rights_holder
        the name of the rights holder (such as the writer or the publisher)

    Each of the criteria has a correspodngin "yomi" criteria as well. For
    example, instead of specifying the song title, you may specify the
    "yomi" of the title like so:

      $jasrac->search(title_yomi => $yomi);

    Also, the value of each criteria may optionally be a hashref, so that
    you can specify the search option, which are O_ZENPOU (prefix match),
    O_BUBUN (partial match), O_KOHO (suffix match), and O_KANZEN (exact
    match). In this case, use the 'text' slot in the hash to supply the
    actual query string:

      $jasrac->search(title => { text => $title, option => O_KANZEN });

    If unspecified, the default for option is O_KANZEN

    Returns a list of WWW::JASRAC::Result objects.
